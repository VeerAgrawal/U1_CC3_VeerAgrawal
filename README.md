Web Scraper & Data Visualizer

what the project does:

When played, this code uses a live updating website to find the top 100 youtubers, and then it calculates their average views per video. After this, the data is provided in a line chart graph. It is possible to change the amount of youtubers data you want to see by changing the value 'dataQuantity'. It takes a lot of time for all 100 youtubers to load. 

Libraries used:
1) pandas
2) matplotlib (pyplot)
3) bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
4) requests
